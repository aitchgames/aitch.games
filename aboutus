                <i>Have fun, don't die.</i><br>
                so Blake's pretty much like the main programmer because the rest of us can't do that. she's also really cool and has <a href="https://twitter.com/blakieboo">twitter</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/blakieboo.aitch.games">bsky</a> now because I convinved her too. oh and also <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/BlakieBoo/">steam</a>. but in general she's a persona enjoyer (not fan) and Number 1 Yu Narukami fan. amateur game dev. Big fan of fighting games (gg, bb, uni, gbvsr, etc) and also a whole lot of ass (rwby, sao, etc) and also owner of 15 volumes of from me to you

                <i>Bingo?</i><br>
                Gavin is a pretty cool guy and he's our main artist because we know literally no one else who can draw so he's kinda being exploited for his labour. but besides that Gavin is a cool guy who also has <a href="https://twitter.com/Woomling">twitter</a> but not <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/woomling.bsky.social">bsky</a> because he hasn't been convinced yet to make the leap. he is the self-proclaimed '#1 polar express fan' though, so I'm sure that that means something

                damien is me (I'm making the website) and he's the main writer because he's kinda just the most qualified for it. obviously everyone can write but out of everyone known he can do it the best. but damien can be found on <a href="https://twitter.com/DamienButTwits">twitter</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/damiennn.ch">bsky</a>, and his website <a href="https://damiennn.ch">damiennn.ch</a> and <a href="http://fr.damiennn.ch/">fr.damiennn.ch</a>. besides that, I don't really have much more to say about myself. look at my websites if you really care enough to know

                so I think you might know what this is<br>
                put simply, /aitchgames/ is a collaborative team group game development thing that we're doing because why not. we're making some cool stuff and we're trying to hit it big I think (we're probably going to fail really badly). but /aitchgames/ as an entity can be primarily found on <a href="https://twitter.com/aitchgames">twitter</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/aitch.games">bsky</a>, <a href="https://github.com/aitchgames">github</a>, and obviously <a href="https://aitch.games">aitch.games</a>
